Chat Life Cycle
Whenever a user connects to your Chainlit app, a new chat session is created. A chat
session goes through a life cycle of events, which you can respond to by defining hooks.
On Chat Start
The on_chat_start decorator is used to define a hook that is called when a new chat
session is created.
On Message
The on_message decorator is used to define a hook that is called when a new message
is received from the user.
On Stop
The  decorator is used to define a hook that is called when the user clicks the
stop button while a task was running.
@cl.on_chat_start
defon_chat_start():
print("A new chat session has started!")
@cl.on_message
defon_message(msg: cl.Message):
print("The user sent: ", msg.content)
